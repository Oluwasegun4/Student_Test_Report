## Student_Test_Report
This repo showcases a project on compiling a student's test report. 

### Walk Through

- After the user enters the student's name, the program proceeds to ask the user to input her scores in six subjects
- The total scores are calculated and the average score is also calculated
- To end the program, the student is classifed by his/her average
  -- Need to improve, if average < 40
  -- Good student, if average is within 40 and 60
  -- Very Good, if student is above 60, but below 85
  -- And exceptional if average is above 85
