## Student_Test_Report
This repo showcases a project on compiling a student's test report. 

### Walk Through

- After the user enters the student's name, the program proceeds to ask the user to input her scores in five subjects
- The total scores are calculated and the average score is also calculated
- To end the program, the student is classifed by his/her average: 
  - Need to improve, if average < 40
  - Good student, if average is within 40 and 60
  - Very Good, if student is above 60, but below 85
  - And exceptional if average is above 85
  
#### Check Score feature
I added a check score part to the code, so the user will not input a value > 100 for any score.
